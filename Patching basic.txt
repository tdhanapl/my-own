patching serevers
# For Debian-based distributions (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Mint), the following commands will let you view available patches and update packages and the operating system:
#sudo apt-get update
#sudo apt-get upgrade 
#sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

#For Red Hat Linux distributions (e.g. RedHat, CentOS, Oracle), the following commands check for updates and patches the system:
#yum check-update
#yum update

#For Suse-based Linux (e.g. Suse Linux Enterprise, OpenSuse), the following commands check for updates and patch the system:
#zypper check-update
#zypper update

# important ######we are doing only security patching  not  updating the kernel level patching that why we exulde the kernel from patching 
yum update --security --exculde=kernel*  -y  
# For update kernel patching  check with below command 
yum check-update

--------------------------------------REDHAT GUDIES OF KERNEL UPDATE---------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
Root permissions
Procedure
1. Optionally, check your kernel version:
# uname -r
3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64
2. Search for a live patching package that corresponds to the version of your kernel:
# yum search $(uname -r)
3. Install the live patching package:
# yum install "kpatch-patch = $(uname -r)"
The command above installs and applies the latest cumulative live patches for that specific
kernel only.
The live patching package contains a patch module, if the package’s version is 1-1 or higher. In
that case the kernel will be automatically patched during the installation of the live patching
package.
The kernel patch module is also installed into the /var/lib/kpatch/ directory to be loaded by the
systemd system and service manager during the future reboots.
NOTE
If there are not yet any live patches available for the given kernel, an empty live
patching package will be installed. An empty live patching package will have a
kpatch_version-kpatch_release of 0-0, for example kpatch-patch-3_10_0-1062-
0-0.el7.x86_64.rpm. The installation of the empty RPM subscribes the system to
all future live patches for the given kernel.
4. Optionally, verify that the kernel is patched:
# kpatch list
Loaded patch modules:
kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1 [enabled]
Installed patch modules:
kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1 (3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64)
…
The output shows that the kernel patch module has been loaded into the kernel, which is now
patched with the latest fixes from the kpatch-patch-3_10_0-1062-1-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
package.

software packages in RHEL 7.
6.7. UPDATING KERNEL PATCH MODULES
Since kernel patch modules are delivered and applied through RPM packages, updating a cumulative
kernel patch module is like updating any other RPM package.
Prerequisites
Root permissions
The system is subscribed to the live patching stream, as described in Section 6.6.1, “Subscribing
to the live patching stream”.
Procedure
Update to a new cumulative version for the current kernel:
# yum update "kpatch-patch = $(uname -r)"
The command above automatically installs and applies any updates that are available for the
currently running kernel. Including any future released cumulative live patches.
Alternatively, update all installed kernel patch modules:
# yum update "kpatch-patch*"
NOTE
When the system reboots into the same kernel, the kernel is automatically live patched
again by the kpatch.service service.
Additional resources
For further information about updating software packages, see the relevant sections of System
Administrator’s Guide.
6.8. DISABLING KERNEL LIVE PATCHING
In case system administrators encountered some unanticipated negative effects connected with the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel live patching solution they have a choice to disable the mechanism. The
following sections describe the ways how to disable the live patching solution.
IMPORTANT
Currently, Red Hat does not support reverting live patches without rebooting your
system. In case of any issues, contact our support team.
6.8.1. Removing the live patching package
The following procedure describes how to disable the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel live patching
solution by removing the live patching package.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Kernel Administration Guide
56
Prerequisites
Root permissions
The live patching package is installed.
Procedure
1. Select the live patching package:
# yum list installed | grep kpatch-patch
kpatch-patch-3_10_0-1062.x86_64 1-1.el7 @@commandline
…
The example output above lists live patching packages that you installed.
2. Remove the live patching package:
# yum remove kpatch-patch-3_10_0-1062.x86_64
When a live patching package is removed, the kernel remains patched until the next reboot, but
the kernel patch module is removed from disk. After the next reboot, the corresponding kernel
will no longer be patched.
3. Reboot your system.
4. Verify that the live patching package has been removed:
# yum list installed | grep kpatch-patch
The command displays no output if the package has been successfully removed.
5. Optionally, verify that the kernel live patching solution is disabled:
# kpatch list
Loaded patch modules:
The example output shows that the kernel is not patched and the live patching solution is not
active because there are no patch modules that are currently loaded.
Additional resources
For more information about the kpatch command-line utility, see the kpatch(1) manual page.
For further information about working with software packages, see the relevant sections of
System Administrator’s Guide.
6.8.2. Uninstalling the kernel patch module
The following procedure describes how to prevent the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel live patching
solution from applying a kernel patch module on subsequent boots.
Prerequisites
Root permissions
CHAPTER 6. APPLYING PATCHES WITH KERNEL LIVE PATCHING
57
A live patching package is installed.
A kernel patch module is installed and loaded.
Procedure
1. Select a kernel patch module:
# kpatch list
Loaded patch modules:
kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1 [enabled]
Installed patch modules:
kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1 (3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64)
…
2. Uninstall the selected kernel patch module:
# kpatch uninstall kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1
uninstalling kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1 (3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64)
Note that the uninstalled kernel patch module is still loaded:
# kpatch list
Loaded patch modules:
kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1 [enabled]
Installed patch modules:
<NO_RESULT>
When the selected module is uninstalled, the kernel remains patched until the next reboot,
but the kernel patch module is removed from disk.
3. Reboot your system.
4. Optionally, verify that the kernel patch module has been uninstalled:
# kpatch list
Loaded patch modules:
The example output above shows no loaded or installed kernel patch modules, therefore the
kernel is not patched and the kernel live patching solution is not active.
Additional resources
For more information about the kpatch command-line utility, refer to the kpatch(1) manual
page.
6.8.3. Disabling kpatch.service
The following procedure describes how to prevent the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel live patching
solution from applying all kernel patch modules globally on subsequent boots.
Prerequisites
Root permissions
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Kernel Administration Guide
58
A live patching package is installed.
A kernel patch module is installed and loaded.
Procedure
1. Verify kpatch.service is enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled kpatch.service
enabled
2. Disable kpatch.service:
# systemctl disable kpatch.service
Removed /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/kpatch.service.
Note that the applied kernel patch module is still loaded:
# kpatch list
Loaded patch modules:
kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1 [enabled]
Installed patch modules:
kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1 (3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64)
3. Reboot your system.
4. Optionally, verify the status of kpatch.service:
# systemctl status kpatch.service
● kpatch.service - "Apply kpatch kernel patches"
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/kpatch.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
Active: inactive (dead)
The example output testifies that kpatch.service has been disabled and is not running.
Thereby, the kernel live patching solution is not active.
5. Verify that the kernel patch module has been unloaded:
# kpatch list
Loaded patch modules:
Installed patch modules:
kpatch_3_10_0_1062_1_1 (3.10.0-1062.el7.x86_64)
The example output above shows that the kernel patch module is still installed but the kernel is
not patched
