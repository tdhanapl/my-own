Directory data is stored in the Ntds.dit file on the domain controller. 
It is recommended that you store this file on an NTFS partition. 
For more information about the tool used to manage the Active Directory database and log files, see Files in Ntdsutil.
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an application protocol used to access and maintain directory services over a network. 
LDAP stores objects, such as usernames and passwords, in directory services, such as Active Directory, and shares that object data across the network.
A domain is a group of objects, such as users or devices, that share the same AD database.
A forest is a group of multiple trees. A forest consists of shared catalogs, directory schemas, application information and domain configurations.
Organizational Units (OUs) organize users, groups and devices. Each domain can contain its own OU.
Trusting terminology
Active Directory relies on trusts to moderate the access rights of resources between domains. There are several different types of trusts:
A one-way trust is when a first domain allows access privileges to users on a second domain. However, the second domain does not allow access to users on the first domain.
A two-way trust is when there are two domains and each domain enables access to users of the other domain.
A trusted domain is a single domain that enables user access to another domain, which is called the trusting domain.
